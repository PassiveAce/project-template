Introduction

Project is about the Irish Election of 2016!
It showcases all the current people who got seats male/female. 
What party their in and how many votes they got.They are split into constituencies and show where they got voted.
Unfortunately the queries i had in this do not work but i wanted to show:
1.How many females got voted.
2.Who was the majority Party voted.

I used the Github Tutorials online to code this work so I used no other sources.
I also got the results of the election  through the Independant and ill link it here:
